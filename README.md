# Resturant-Menu-Reservation
A small resturant menu, with reservation section and a random meal selection button

This was a group project that was created with one other person. We created this project as part of a Javascript Final Project.

The main objectives of this project was:

<ul>
<li> Make Changes to the HTML and/or CSS using Javascript</li>
<li> Get input from the user</li>
<li>Use an event to trigger change to the webpage</li>
<li>Add HTML elements to the webpage using DOM</li>
<li>Use Arrays, loops and/or conditional logic in Javascript</li>
</ul>

We achieved this by creating an Array with menu items in it and creating a loop which inputed the menu items on to the page.

We created an event listener than would collect the data from the form from the reservation and edit the inner hmtl of the page to display the reservation details.

We created a randomized function which allowed the user to select a random menu item if they couldnt decide for their reservation.

We created an avaliable dates function that took the next 5 avalaible dates and capacity to correspond with the reservation and if they where full displayed a message.
