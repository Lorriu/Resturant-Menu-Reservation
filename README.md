## Main Objectives

The main objectives of this project were:

1. Make Changes to the HTML and/or CSS using JavaScript.
2. Get input from the user.
3. Use an event to trigger changes to the webpage.
4. Add HTML elements to the webpage using the DOM.
5. Utilize arrays, loops, and conditional logic in JavaScript.

## Project Details

We achieved these objectives by implementing the following:

- **Menu Creation**: We created an array containing menu items and used a loop to dynamically insert these items onto the webpage.

- **Reservation System**: We implemented an event listener that collects user input from the reservation form and updates the HTML to display the reservation details.

- **Random Meal Selection**: To help users who couldn't decide on their reservation, we added a random meal selection button.
